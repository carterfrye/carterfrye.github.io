            <h1>Hey there!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Carter Frye. I’m an identity designer, illustrator, and an entrepreneur.
                <br>
                <br>

                I study graphic design, entrepreneurship and information science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h2>What I do:</h2>
            <p>I am the Graphic Design Editor for Coulture Magazine as well as a design assistant for my Carolina Student Union. I create things that people connect to, and I often ask them to think differently. At Coulture, UNC’s student run premiere fashion and lifestyle magazine, I use design to represent diverse perspectives and people groups. At the Union, I work to create content that engages students and university friends alike towards a multitude of initiatives of the Union itself and of student organizations.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Current passion project:</h2>
            <p>I am starting a podcast on campus alongside my friend exploring the queer experience on campus. We are seeking visibility for the whole queer community, and especially trying to create more spaces in which the LQBTQ+ can share our perspectives and share them with our allies in the world. Ask me about it!</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>You can find me:</h2>
            <p>reading, obsessing over typography, listening to podcasts, waking up early, staying up late, playing any sport, doing yoga and calisthenics, going towards mountains, going towards water, sketching, drinking cold coffee, and the list continues.</p>
